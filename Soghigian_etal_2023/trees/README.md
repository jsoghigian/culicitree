Phylogenies from Soghigian et al. 2023.

aa_ml_subgenus.tre - The maximum likelihood topology from IQ-Tree, with tip labels including subgenus. Support values are not shown if they were 100/100.

aa_pruned_75.models.iqtree - The IQTree output file for the maximum likelihood analysis we describe in our paper.

dated_phylogeny.tre - The dated phylogeny from MCMCTree.

aa_astral.speciesID.tre - Results from ASTRAL based on amino acid gene trees

aa_astral.214.speciesID.tre - Results from ASTRAL based on amino acid gene trees, requiring a minimum of 214 tips.

aa_astral.241.speciesID.tre - Results from ASTRAL based on amino acid gene trees, requiring a minimum of 241 tips.

alltribes_posterior_20220716.trees - The TACT-generated trees including all mosquito tribes

mcc.alltribes_posterior_20220716.tre - The maximum clade credibility tree generated from the above "all tribes" TACT trees.

sampledtribes_posterior_20220716.trees - TACT generated trees including only mosquito tribes for which we had molecular data (thus excluding Hodgesiini and Ficalbiini)

mcc.sampledtribes_posterior_20220716.tre - The maximum clade credibility tree generated from the above "sampled tribes" TACT trees.
