Data and resulting tree files analyzed in Soghigian et al. 2023 . Due to the size of the nucleotide alignment, it is only available on our Figshare DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.23826144

We noticed recently that the alignments used to generate Supplementary File 10, the amino acid phylogeny of genomes and transcriptomes, were unintentionally not included with the first upload of alignment files. We have now uploaded both nucleotide (nt_genomestrans_75.tar.bz2) and amino acids (aa_genomestrans_75.tar.bz2) here.
