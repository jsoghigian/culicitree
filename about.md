title: About Culicitree
---

Culicitree is an NSF-funded, international collaborative effort to bring phylogenomic methods to bear on the Culicidae. We are leveraging genomic resources and sequence capture to construct a species level phylogeny of mosquitoes, so that we can better understand the evolution and consequences of important mosquito phenotypes.

The lead PI on the Culicitree project is Brian Wiegmann at North Carolina State University, but the project is a collaborative effort that includes Michael Reiskind at North Carolina Stat University, Yvonne-Marie Linton at the The Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit / Smithsonian Institution, Michelle Trautwin at the California Academy of Sciences, David Yeates of the Australian National Insect Collection, and John Soghigian at the University of Calgary.
