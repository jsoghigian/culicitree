This is the web home of the Culicitree Project, an NSF-funded, international effort to provide robust inference of mosquito phylogeny.  In the near future, we will publish phylogenomic analyses, accompanied by extensive ecological datasets and other resources.  This is a work in progress, and we always welcome additional collaborators.
