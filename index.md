This is the web home of the Culicitree Project, an NSF-funded, international effort to provide robust inference of mosquito phylogeny.  In the near future, we will publish phylogenomic analyses, accompanied by extensive ecological datasets and other resources.  This website is still under construction, so please be patient.  For questions or inquiries on the Culicitree project or this website, please email Dr. [John Soghigian](mailto:john.soghigian@ucalgary.ca).
